title: Don't Stir the Rice!
---

I'm taking a controversial stance. I'm telling you to **not** stir the rice. Don't do it. Once you put the lid on that pot of gold, don't lift it up until the blessed steam has cooked your rice to perfection. Now, I know *some* of you might have a few objections, so I've decided to address these concerns.

## 1. But the rice will stick to the bottom

Good. This is possibly the best part. Even if you don't like the miniscule layer of crunchy goodness, it's a small price to pay for perfect rice. If the bottom layer of rice is completely charred, then you probably have the stove too high, anyways.

## 2. How will I Know it's Cooked?

Follow the wisdom found on the vast interwebs. I might not be an expert cook, but I can find their advice pretty easily nowdays. Start by following the instructions, then change the timing and heat until you find your kitchen's sweetspot. Voila.
