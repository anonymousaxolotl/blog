I've been fiddling around with some old Crayola watercolors and cheap Walmart paper, but it just wasn't holding up to what I see on those perfect Instagram videos of people painting flowers and stuff. I had a Michael's gift card, so I decided to step my watercolor game up a notchâ€¦ or maybe twenty notches.

I decided to go with the Winsor & Newton Sketcher's Pocket Box and a small Strathmore watercolor notebook. I got the pocket box because it was the cheapest Winsor & Newton set they had and I figured having a limited range of colors would teach me how to mix colors rather than rely on premade colors. With the paper I picked whatever looked best, as I had no idea what brands were good or not. With a little more research I learned that Strathmore is actually a pretty good brand, though I'm not sure I actually got their better paper.

So I drew a quick picture with my trusty Pilot Metropolitan filled with Noodler's Black. I was very happy to find it didn't feather like the cheap Walmart paper or take forever to dry like ultra smooth or coated paper does.

I probably should have stretched the paper, but I had already drawn the outlines. Oh well. The watercolors were much easier to direct than the cheap ones I've used before. I actually had fun using watercolors! My brother also painted a picture and agrees that these are MUCH better than the ones used at school.
